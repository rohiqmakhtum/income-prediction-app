A machine learning application to predict adult income based on demographic and employment features. Built using Scikit-learn and deployed with Streamlit. This project compares various ML models and includes hyperparameter tuning with `GridSearchCV`.

## üîç Features

- Classification using Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM
- Pipeline preprocessing (scaling & one-hot encoding)
- Evaluation with classification report, confusion matrix & cross-validation
- Hyperparameter tuning with `GridSearchCV`
- Streamlit UI for live predictions
- Model saved with `joblib` and reusable
